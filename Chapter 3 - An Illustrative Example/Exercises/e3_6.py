We have the following two prototype vectors:
    p1 = [-1, 1].T    p2 = [1,1].T

i.    Find and sketch a decision boundary for a perceptron network that will recognize these two vectors.
ii.   Find weights and bias that will produce the decision boundary you found in part i.
iii.  Draw the network diagram using abreviated notation.
iv.   For the vector given below, calculate the net input, n, and the network output, a, for the network you have designed.  Does the network produce a good output? Explain.
v.    Design a Hamming network to recognize the two vectors used in part i.
vi.   Calculate the network output for the Hamming network for the input vector given in part iv.  Does the network produce a good output? Explain.
vii.  Design a Hopfield network to recognize the two vectors used in part i.
viii. Calculate the network output for the Hopfield network for the input vector given in part iv.  Does the network produce a good output? Explain.
