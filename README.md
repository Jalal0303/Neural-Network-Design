I have completed notes and exercies for Chapters 2-4.  I will come back to this book when I have time.  In the meantime, additional chapter solutions have been completed by [@estamos](https://github.com/estamos/Neural-Network-Design-Solutions-Manual) including Chapters [10](https://github.com/estamos/Neural-Network-Design-Solutions-Manual/tree/master/Chapter%2010), [11](https://github.com/estamos/Neural-Network-Design-Solutions-Manual/tree/master/Chapter%2011), [12](https://github.com/estamos/Neural-Network-Design-Solutions-Manual/tree/master/Chapter%2012), [16](https://github.com/estamos/Neural-Network-Design-Solutions-Manual/tree/master/Chapter%2016), and [17](https://github.com/estamos/Neural-Network-Design-Solutions-Manual/tree/master/Chapter%2017).  The pdfs are written in Greek but you can use google translator.
